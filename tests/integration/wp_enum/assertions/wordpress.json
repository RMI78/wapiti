Post Types marked as noindex will not appear in the sitemap. [Learn more about XML Sitemaps](https://yoa.st/3qt).\n\n= How can I add my website to Google Search Console? =\n\nIt is straightforward to add your website to Google Search Console.\n1. Create a Google Search Console account and login into your account.\n2. Click \u2018Add a property\u2019 under the search drop-down.\n3. Enter your website URL in the box and click \u2018Continue\u2019.\n4. Click the arrow next to \u2018HTML tag\u2019 to expand the option.\n5. Copy the meta tag.\n6.

Please contact the theme developer for a permanent solution. We\u2019ve written an article about the [importance of breadcrumbs for SEO](https://yoa.st/3qv).\n\nTo implement the [breadcrumbs](https://yoa.st/3qw) function in Yoast SEO, you will have to edit your theme. We recommend that prior to any editing of the theme files, a backup is taken. Your host provider can help you take a backup.\nCopy the following code into your theme where you want the breadcrumbs to be. If you are not sure, you will need to experiment with placement:\n\n<code>\n<?php\nif ( function_exists( 'yoast_breadcrumb' ) ) {\n    yoast_breadcrumb( '<p id=\"breadcrumbs\">','</p>' );\n}\n?>\n</code>\n\nCommon places where you could place your breadcrumbs are inside your `single.php` and/or `page.php` file just above the page\u2019s title. Another option that makes it really easy in some themes is by just pasting the code in `header.php` at the very end.\n\nIn most non-WooTheme themes, this code snippet should not be added to your `functions.php` file.\nAlternatively, you can manually add the breadcrumb shortcode to individual posts or pages: `[wpseo_breadcrumb]`\n\nIf you need more details or a step by step guide, read our [Implementation guide for Yoast SEO breadcrumbs](https://yoa.st/3qx).\n\n= How do I noindex URLS? =\n\nYoast SEO provides multiple options for setting a URL or group of URLs to noindex. [Read more about how to do this in this guide](https://yoa.st/3qy/).\n\n= Google shows the wrong description, how do I fix this? =\n\nIf you\u2019ve crafted nice meta descriptions for your blog posts, nothing is more annoying than Google showing another description for your site completely in the search result snippet.\n\nPossible causes could be:\n1. wrong description in code\n2. Google cache is outdated\n3. Search term manipulation\n4. Google ignored the meta description\n\nYou can [read more here on how to solve the issue with the wrong description](https://yoa.st/3qz).\n\n= How often is Yoast SEO updated? =\n\nYoast SEO is updated every two weeks. If you want to know why, please read [this post on why we release every two weeks](https://yoa.st/3q-)!\n\n= How do I get support? =\n\nAs our free plugin is used by millions of people worldwide, we cannot offer you all one on one support. If you have trouble with the Yoast SEO for WordPress plugin, you can get help on the support forums here at [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wordpress-seo/) or by checking out our help center at [yoast.com/help/](https://yoa.st/3r1).\n\nThe plugins you buy at Yoast are called \u2018premium plugins\u2019 (even if Premium isn\u2019t in its name) and include a complete year of free updates and premium support.

However, it\u2019s recommended to integrate them both into your overall WordPress security strategy. An SSL certificate (Secure Sockets Layer certificate) creates a secure connection between your website and your site visitors\u2019 browsers. It encrypts any data shared on your site \u2014 like addresses, emails, phone numbers, and credit card information \u2014 and protects that data from hackers.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have an SSL certificate, your site will show a \u201cnot secure\u201d warning on users\u2019 browsers, which can reduce your legitimacy in their eyes. SSL certificates also have a positive impact on search engine rankings.\n\nThe process of setting up an SSL certificate will depend on your hosting provider. Some hosts include free certificates, while others charge annually.\n\n= How does Jetpack work with WP Super Cache? =\n\nWP Super Cache works by caching your WordPress pages as static HTML pages so that page requests, for an already cached page, do not need to be processed by the WordPress PHP scripts. Typically, most visitors of your site will view cached versions of the WordPress pages, so your server will have more processing power to serve an increased number of users.\n\nJetpack has an image CDN that works by caching and serving your WordPress images globally from its own servers. These plugins are both maintained by Automattic and work together to give you ultimate site speed.\n\n= What version of PHP do I need? =\n\nSites must be built on PHP 5.6 or greater, but Jetpack always supports the latest version of PHP.\n\n= Can Jetpack help my site comply with GDPR? =\n\nOur Cookie and Consent Banner can help you comply with GDPR. The European Union\u2019s ePrivacy Directive (often referred to as the \u2018cookie law\u2019) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) place requirements on website owners and operators to provide information about, and gain consent for their use of cookies.\n\n= Can Jetpack be used to transfer websites to a new host? =\n\nJetpack Backup can do a full website migration to a new host, migrate theme files and plugins to a new database, create full database backups, clone websites, repair broken websites by restoring older backups and allow you to easily set up a test site by creating a duplicate of your existing website.\n\n\n== Screenshots ==\n\n1.

Save every change with real-time backups and get back online quickly with one-click restores.\n3. Automated malware scanning and one-click fixes keep your site one step ahead of security threats.\n4.

With their pre-built form templates and the drag & drop builder, I can create a new form that works in less than 2 minutes without writing a single line of code. Well worth the investment.<br>\n> David Henzel - Co-founder of MaxCDN\n\n= Surveys & Polls =\n\nAlong with contact form, you can also use WPForms to create surveys and polls.\n\nOur <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/surveys-and-polls-addon/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"friend\">WordPress Survey plugin addon</a> comes with smart survey fields including likert scale, star ratings, multiple choice, Net Promoter Score (NPS), and more, so you can create custom survey forms like Survey Monkey (without the high costs).\n\nWPForms offer the best-in class survey reporting. You can use our interactive reports to customize the graphs, export them for your presentations, and even display the aggregate results to your users.\n\nThe best part about WPForms survey reports is that it can retroactively work on any old contact form or feedback survey contact form created with WPForms.\n\nThousands of businesses love WPForms surveys for creating employee feedback form, customer feedback form, online petition form, and more.\n\nYou can also use the surveys & polls addon to easily create a poll on your site. To save you time when creating a user poll, we have added a built-in poll forms template. Our poll feature offers real-time reports, so you can share poll results with the user immediately after they submit their vote.\n\nJust like the contact form, you can embed your surveys and polls inside any post, page, or widget area in WordPress.\n\n= Membership and Default WordPress Forms =\n\nAside from building simple contact forms which every WordPress site needs, WPForms also helps you create better default WordPress forms.\n\nFor example, you can use WPForms to create custom WordPress login forms and custom WordPress user registration forms which are great for <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/ultimate-guide-to-creating-a-wordpress-membership-site/\">membership sites</a>.\n\nFor membership sites, you can also use WPForms to create a password-protected contact form or even a members only contact form which is restricted to logged-in users only.\n\nEven if you're not using a WordPress membership plugin, you can use WPForms to create membership registration forms, online RSVP forms, and other address book contact forms.\n\nBloggers and publishers can use our WordPress post submission forms to accept guest posts, testimonials contact form to collect testimonials, and partnership agreement forms to grow their business.\n\n= Payment Form, Donation Form, Booking Form, and More =\n\nWhile WPForms started out as a contact form plugin, it has evolved into a powerful custom forms solution that you can use to create a payment form, donation form, registration form, online booking form, mobile form, and basically any type of custom form you need.\n\nWPForms integrates with both PayPal, Stripe, Square, and Authorize.Net so you can easily create a credit card payment form to accept payments on your website. If you're using SSL, then you can use our Stripe, Square, or Authorize.Net Payment forms to accept credit card payments directly on your website. Alternatively you can use our PayPal payment form to make a donation form and accept payments online.\n\nAside from simple order forms, business owners also use WPForms to create custom product purchase forms, t-shirt order forms, online booking forms, and more.\n\nWe understand that sometimes you may need to create a contact form that require a signature. WPForms comes with a signature field to collect user signature on your WordPress forms or even create custom signature forms.\n\nYou can do all of this while still using the same easy-to-use contact form builder that's loved by over 5 million users.\n\n>I am so impressed with this plugin. I decided to give it a shot over some of the other form plugins, and I am so glad I did. It works well, is so easy to use and customize. The support is amazing on top of it all. I got the pro version because I was so pleased. Highly recommend.<br>\n> Micky73 - WordPress user\n\n= Forms that are Optimized for Conversion and Results =\n\nWith our Form Pages addon, you can create distraction-free custom form landing pages like Google Forms and Wufoo right inside WordPress, so you can increase conversions without the high costs (<a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/form-pages-addon/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"friend\">See Form Pages Demo</a>).\n\nTo improve form completion rate, we created Conversational Forms&reg; which helps you make your generic feedback form and other custom contact forms feel more human by adding an interactive form layout.

Install Wordfence automatically or by uploading the ZIP file. \n2. Activate the Wordfence through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress. Wordfence is now activated.\n3. Go to the scan menu and start your first scan. Scheduled scanning will also be enabled.\n4. Once your first scan has completed, a list of threats will appear. Go through them one by one to secure your site.\n5. Visit the Wordfence options page to enter your email address so that you can receive email security alerts.\n6. Optionally, change your security level or adjust the advanced options to set individual scanning and protection options for your site.\n7. Click the \"Live Traffic\" menu option to watch your site activity in real-time. Situational awareness is an important part of website security.\n\nTo install Wordfence on WordPress Multi-Site installations:\n\n1. Install Wordfence via the plugin directory or by uploading the ZIP file.\n2. Network Activate Wordfence. This step is important because until you network activate it, your sites will see the plugin option on their plugins menu. Once activated that option disappears. \n3. Now that Wordfence is network activated it will appear on your Network Admin menu. Wordfence will not appear on any individual site's menu. \n4. Go to the \"Scan\" menu and start your first scan. \n5. Wordfence will do a scan of all files in your WordPress installation including those in the blogs.dir directory of your individual sites. \n6. Live Traffic will appear for ALL sites in your network. If you have a heavily trafficked system you may want to disable live traffic which will stop logging to the DB. \n7. Firewall rules and login rules apply to the WHOLE system. So if you fail a login on site1.example.com and site2.example.com it counts as 2 failures. Crawler traffic is counted between blogs, so if you hit three sites in the network, all the hits are totalled and that counts as the rate you're accessing the system.\n\n== Frequently Asked Questions ==\n\n[Visit our website to access our official documentation which includes security feature descriptions, common solutions and comprehensive help.](https://wordfence.com/help/)\n\n= How does Wordfence Security protect sites from attackers? =\n\nThe WordPress security plugin provides the best protection available for your website.

Learn more about the [Cloud WAF identity problem here](https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2016/10/endpoint-vs-cloud-security-cloud-waf-user-identity-problem/). Additionally, cloud based firewalls can be bypassed, leaving your site exposed to attackers. Because Wordfence is an integral part of the endpoint (your WordPress website), it can\u2019t be bypassed.
